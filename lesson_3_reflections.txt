1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

This would usually be applicable whenever you are working on a project
from multiple computers and/or you are only making commits to a
particular file, but want to store the rest of the files on GitHub.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The reason for this primarily is because if you were working on a
project which is already set up to be synchronized with GitHub, an
automatic pull could prove disruptive and erase any progress that has
been made on the project. Therefore, manual pull is almost always the
better option.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

A branch is a particular lineage of commits - some branches may split
into two or more branches at certain nodes, for various reasons. A
clone is an exact copy of a repository, which is made to or within a
local directory, or from a GitHub account. A fork is a GitHub-generated
clone of a GitHub repository, from one account to another, which adds
in the ability to suggest changes to the original author, as well as
having the copied repository refer to the original repository on
GitHub.

You would utilize or create branches whenever you have a saved project
on your local directory or GitHub account, but want to create a
different version or experimental version of the project. You would
clone a repository whenever you wanted to create a copy of a repository
to or within a local directory, usually for purposes of utilizing or
editing them. You would fork a repository whenever you would want to
copy a repository from someone else's GitHub account to your own, for
purposes of suggesting changes to the original author, and/or editing/
modifying that repository for various purposes.
